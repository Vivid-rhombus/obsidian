Logos: Facts and receipts for the problem and potential crowd.

Pathos: We are creating a space that rewards having a healthy discourse. imagine a platform where you can exchange different opinions and ideas respectfully while having your arguments reviewed by both sides of the aisle, having the opportunity to really see why the other side thinks as he does.
